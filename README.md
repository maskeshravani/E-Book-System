# E-Book-System


This Book Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage books using Hibernate, Servlets, and MySQL. It follows the MVC architecture to organize the code into models, views, and controllers, making it easy to maintain and scale.

The system allows for basic CRUD operations on books, including adding new books, viewing details of specific books, editing existing books, and deleting them. Hibernate ORM simplifies database interactions, and the project uses Apache Tomcat as the server.

Add Book: Admins can add books with title, author, and price.

View Book: Retrieve and view a bookâ€™s details by ID.


View All Books: List all available books in the system.

Update Book: Modify existing book information (title, author, price).
